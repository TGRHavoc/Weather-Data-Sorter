## Weather Data Processing

The assignment was to design and implement a Search and Sort application.
In particular, I was asked to create a Console Application, which will help with the analysis of Weather Data.
The data the program uses comes from the Met Office Historical Data website ([Link](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate-historic/)) from two
weather stations between December 1930 and January 2016.
The first weather station used (WS1) is located in Lerwick and the second weather station (WS2) is located in Ross on Wye.

### Running the application

To run the program, simply run the .exe file that is located in the "Release" folder located in the main directory.
When asked to select the data directory select the "data" folder located in the same directory as the application.
